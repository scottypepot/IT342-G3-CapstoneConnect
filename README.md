NAME: Scott Benzer Gitgano
COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-3

A 20 Years old who likes to play video games and like to challenge himself. Playing games is one of my hobbies like there's no day without playing. I also like to 
Challenge myself like learning new coding languages like javascript or react js. I know that learning that languages is not easy and you need to spend more time of it. Aside from that i also like watching videos like movies or series specifically kdrama or anime.
