NAME: Scott Benzer Gitgano
COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-3

A 20 Years old who likes to play video games and like to challenge himself. Playing games is one of my hobbies like there's no day without playing. I also like to 
Challenge myself like learning new coding languages like javascript or react js. I know that learning that languages is not easy and you need to spend more time of it. Aside from that i also like watching videos like movies or series specifically kdrama or anime.

NAME: John Gerard C. Donaire
COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-3

A 20 year old BSIT student at CIT-University who thrives on curiosity—whether it’s coding, hitting the gym, or chasing new adventures. My days are fueled by matcha, KDrama marathons, and a relentless drive to improve myself. I believe life’s too short for maybes, so I say ‘yes’ to spontaneous trips, weird hobbies, and challenges that push me out of my comfort zone—because growth happens where the routine ends. I’m building a life where discipline meets dopamine, one bug fix, dumbbell set, or plot twist at a time.
